[![Trailhead: Navigate the Salesforce Advantage](/assets/img/2016/02/22/trail_banner.png)](https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead/trail/salesforce_advantage)


The Trailhead team released another set of fantastic [modules](https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead/trail/salesforce_advantage) this past week.  But unlike many of the other modules, these delve into the world of Salesforce itself, and not really into Salesforce the product.  Let's take a look into each of these modules a bit deeper.

# Salesforce Success Model

This Trailhead module consists of two units.  The first gives a brief overview of what Salesforce the platform is (at a 10,000ft level).  The second discusses the four core differentiators, a brief look at how Salesforce started and then a explanation of Salesforce's fantastic 1-1-1 model.

# Salesforce Cloud Benefits

This Trailhead module also consists of two units.  The first talking about what the Salesforce CRM is as well as the different service app clouds that are available.  The second module helps to describe what cloud computing is and how it compares to on-premise computing options.

# Salesforce Technology Basics

This is the largest of the four modules containing four units.  The first unit covers how trust is managed at Salesforce.  The second discusses how multitenancy works with the platform.  The third unit helps demystify the word metadata and explains what it means to Salesforce.  The last module, gives an overview of how all three of the previous units mean that Salesforce can deliver fast app development and customization.

# Salesforce Ecosystem

The last module discusses how the Salesforce ecosystem and customer community makes Salesforce a strong company.  The first unit discusses how to get involved via Dreamforce, local events, the AppExchange or with partners.  The second unit talks about how to collaborate by joining the Success Community, your local user group or by connecting with MVPs.

# Trailhead Summary

Personally, I'm glad to see the Trailhead team expanding their content library outside of the typical admin / developer how-tos.  I think it's very important to realize who the target audience for these modules are.  These modules are not designed for those of us who have been working on the platform for years, present and multiple user groups and wait with baited breath for the Dreamforce Call for Papers to open.  These modules target people who are brand new to Salesforce and want to know more about the company and not about how to create a workflow.  I can see how these modules would be really useful for a company's management to understand what they are looking to buy into.
