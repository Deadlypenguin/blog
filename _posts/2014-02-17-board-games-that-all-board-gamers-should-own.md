Now I know this is a bit out of the realm of "normalcy" for my blog, but I think there is a bit of overlap in people who would read this, and people who play board games.  This list was generated by several suggestions of board gaming friends of mine.  It is by no way 100% accurate or complete.  We tried to get at least two suggestions per category and from there you can decide.
