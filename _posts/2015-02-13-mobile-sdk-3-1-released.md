At the end of last year, Salesforce released the [Mobile SDK 3.0](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/11/cross-platform-apps-salesforce-mobile-sdk-web-components.html "Mobile SDK 3.0") which added quite a few new features.  Now, they've released the Mobile SDK 3.1 with some really nice new features.  I have not had a chance to dive into the Mobile SDK prior to this release, but I think it's made some great progress and should be something to give a try of.

# Background on the Mobile SDK

![Mobile SDK Unified Cross Platform Architecture](/assets/img/2015/02/13/architecture.png)

The mobile SDK is a great way to write native apps for iOS, Android or hybrid apps using a number of web frameworks.

# What's new?

The updated SDK includes:

* A more consistent implementation for native and hybrid apps for iOS and Android
* Full CRUD operations for both online and offline usage
* CocoaPods for iOS
* Library updates

# What can I do with this?

The updated mobile SDK makes it even easier now to get started with [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) now being fully supported for native apps. To get started, checkout the [Mobile SDK wiki page](https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Mobile_SDK) for the learning path you want to take.  You can also take a look at the [Android](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android/tree/master/native/SampleApps/SmartSyncExplorer), [iOS](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS/tree/master/native/SampleApps/SmartSyncExplorer) or [Hybrid](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/11/cross-platform-apps-salesforce-mobile-sdk-web-components.html) sample apps to get started.
