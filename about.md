Well hello there.  My name's Patrick and I'm a pretty technical guy, and I love technical things.

This is blog about stuff that I've discovered while working.  I might throw random crap in here, but for the most part it will be pretty technical, and may have random bursts of code.

To learn more about me head over to my aptly names <a title="About.me" href="http://about.me/patrick.connelly" target="_blank">about.me</a> page where you can find all the links to my twitter, website and the like.
