When designing my new blog layout I started the way that most developers and designers now a days do, I started with a mobile first design.  I wanted something that scales well, looks good on mobile and desktop but is still pretty.  With more and more frameworks out there, this is getting pretty easy.  I decided on [bulma](https://bulma.io/) and once that was out of the way I was off to the races.  While working on the design I got to thinking about a recent talk I saw at [Dreamforce](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/) about accessibility and I thought that this was the perfect time to design with that in mind.  In this post I'm going to cover some of the design decisions that were made as well as some things that I had assumed and got wrong.
